### Project Overview
---


This data analysis project aims to provide insights from a survey, and evaluate the responses of users of a company regarding their products.

Understanding user sentiment is crucial for any organization as it directly impacts various aspects of business operations. By analyzing the responses of users in surveys, organizations can gain valuable insights into how their products are perceived in the market. 

Positive sentiment indicates satisfaction with the products and can lead to increased customer loyalty, repeat purchases, and positive word-of-mouth referrals. Conversely, negative sentiment highlights areas for improvement, such as product defects, poor customer service, or dissatisfaction with features, which can inform strategic decision-making and drive product enhancements or service improvements. By gauging user sentiment, a business can adapt its offerings to better meet customer needs, enhance brand reputation, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools

- Excel & Power Query- Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Visualization.
  

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
